# Gustavo S.

Hey! I'm a curious person who loves to break things (and sometimes even fix them).

This is my personal website and portfolio.

**Live at:** https://guslwl.github.io

### Built with

- [hacked-jekyll](https://github.com/piazzai/hacked-jekyll) – a minimal, JSON-looking theme for Jekyll
- Jekyll + GitHub Pages (100 % static, zero cost, loads instantly)

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git
cd your-username.github.io
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0

Visit: http://localhost:4000

> Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username (twice), save as `README.md`, commit & push.
```

Feel free to fork it!
If you do, tag me or drop the link somewhere, I’d love to see your version

Made with ≈, Vim, and way too many open tabs.
